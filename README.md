This project was created as a disk environment to desktop projects under development. The goal is isolate the system folders (`~/.config`, `~/.local`, etc) and allow that a production and a development version could coexist in a same machine, with no risk of the development version alter production data.

This project is just a folder structure to be used as model. To use it, just clone it, delete the .git directory and configure your project to use this structure in development environment.
